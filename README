YT Scoreboard is a scoreboard written for HUBBLE.

To install, you need the latest version of Node.js (see nodejs.org for instructions) and npm to install Hubble. (sudo npm install -g hubble)

Once Node.js and Hubble have been installed, simply run hubble Yippeetech.coffee.

You can edit Yippeetech.coffee or you can live update it through curl. The former is preferred. Note, you will have to 'q' out and then restart.
